This assignment was made to solve the following problem:

Give an algorithm for the following problem and determine its time complexity. Given a list of n distinct positive integers, 
partition the list into two sublists, each of size n/2, such that the difference between the sums of the integers in the two sublists 
is maximized. You may assume that n is a multiple of 2.
